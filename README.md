## What is the RepTracker app
As stated in the name, the purpose of the RepTracker is to allow users to keep a record of their gym progress (reps and sets for a specific workout, the date of when they did the workout). This may seem little, but is actually very useful as it can inform user's whether they are making progress or not. 

## Features
**Rest timer:** This is a simple timer located on the main screen. This timer will have to be manually started by user's and once te timer ends, it will send a notification to the user's phone to allow the user's to know that their rest time has ended and should start their next set. The duration of the timer can be changed by the user to meet their desired rest duration. 

**Logbook:** This is a feature that allow users to keep a record of their progress such as numbers of reps and sets for a workout, as well as the date that the workout was completed on.
