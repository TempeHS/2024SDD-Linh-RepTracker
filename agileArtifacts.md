# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog lists of achieveables (annotate what changes made during sprint, including data required)
~~1. A timer that counts down from the user's desired time duration and sends a notification to the user's phone once it ends~~ (I coudln't get the service worker to work as I don't understand it so the app only sends notification to desktop devices.)
~~2. Buttons that allow the user to adjust the duration of the timer~~
3. a landing page for the user documentation
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A timer button that counts down from the user's desired duration

A notification system that sends a notification to the user's desktop devices when the timer ends

Buttons that changes the duration of the timer

A landing page for the user documentation which guides the user through the app


## Sprint review (Focus on project management)
### What challenge did you have


### What did you do well


### What will you do different next time
