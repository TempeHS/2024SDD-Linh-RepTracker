# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog lists of achieveables (annotate what changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. a database that stores the user's logbook
2. a landing page for the logbook

## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A landing page that will be linked with the exercise library button and a database that pushes data from the backend to the frontend

## Sprint review (Focus on project management)
### What challenge did you have

### What did you do well


### What will you do different next time
