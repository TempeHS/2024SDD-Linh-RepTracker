# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog lists of achieveables (annotate what changes made during sprint, including data required)
1. ~~landing page with 4 buttons~~
2. ~~logo and banner design~~

## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
1. A UI of the landing page for the app

## Sprint review (Focus on project management)
### What challenge did you have
I had some trouble with the UI as I mistakenly used a circle instead of an actual circular shaped button
### What did you do well
I believe I solved the issue well, spotting the situation and working to resolve it

### What will you do different next time
Be more efficient and be more organised with my work
