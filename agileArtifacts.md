# Agile Artifacts
## Sprint backlog lists of achieveables (annotate what changes made during sprint, including data required)
~~1. A timer that counts down from the user's desired time duration and sends a notification to the user's phone once it ends~~ (I coudln't get the service worker to work as I don't understand it so the app only sends notification to desktop devices.)
~~2. Buttons that allow the user to adjust the duration of the timer~~
~~3. a landing page for the user documentation~~
## Increment (what must be achieved by the end of the sprint)
A timer button that counts down from the user's desired duration

A notification system that sends a notification to the user's desktop devices when the timer ends (this has been changed from sending notifcation to phone)

Buttons that changes the duration of the timer

A landing page for the user documentation which guides the user through the app


## Sprint review (Focus on project management)
### What challenge did you have
I had challanges with getting the notification to work on mobile devices. I was not able to complete this so the app can now only send notification to desktop devices.

### What did you do well
I think I did well in finding and implementing a solution to my problem such as the notification api and the timer setting. 

### What will you do different next time
I will spend less time on a problem that I can't solve and move on to something else then come back to the previous problem if I have time.
